if x and y are two numbers then number of set bits in (x||y) + (x & y) = number of set bits in x + number of set bits in y.

- (a^b)^c = a^(b^c) used to find unique number in the array of two duplicate numbers. #LeetCode (260)

To convert into gray, we will take the number and perform XOR after shifting the number 1 bit to the right.

- Qno # 1178

if in an array XOR of elements bw indices i and j (0<=i<j<arr.size) is zero then XOR of elements X (arr[i]^arr[i+1]^....arr[k-1]) is equal to XOR of elementes Y (arr[k]^arr[k+1]^...arr[j])

- to find whether number has atmost one set bit  =  if((a & (a-1))==0) then true;

if a^b  = c then a = c^b, b = c^a;
